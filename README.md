## About

The `NotesSummary.py` script allows users to take notes for different classes and chapters of textbooks. It prompts the user to select a class ('ethics', 'datastruct', or 'principle'), enter the chapter name, section name, and content. It then generates formatted notes and appends them to the 'notes_output.txt' file.

The `QuizletSummary.py` script generates concise, unique, and interesting interview questions and answers. Users can enter the content, and the script formats it as a question and answer pair. The generated pairs are appended to the 'quizlet_output.txt' file.

## Usage

To use the `NotesSummary.py` script, run the following command:

```python
python NotesSummary.py

The script will prompt you to enter the class, chapter, section name, and content for your notes. Press 'q' to quit entering sections.

To use the `QuizletSummary.py` script, run the following command:
